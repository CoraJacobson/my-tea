# MyTea

MyTea provides the tea enthusiast with everything needed to log and use a tea collection - users can input their teas, sort them to find today's perfect cup, and customize the timers to help track infusions for each tea in their collection.

This is a work in progress, and is intended as a gift for my mother. With high quality, loose leaf tea, you can get several infusions from the same tea leaves, and the flavor and nutritional content both change in subtle ways throughout the process. In general, each successive steeping should be a little longer than the previous one, and my mother has trouble remembering which infusion she is on and how long to steep her tea. So I decided to build an app that would enable her to keep track of her tea, in the cupboard and in the teapot.

The project is built using the Coordinator pattern, and does not use a storyboard. It is essentially a UIKit app, but has some SwiftUI views. It uses CoreData for local persistence, and also makes use of UserDefaults for some user settings. Please check out my [user flow diagram](https://github.com/CoraJacobson/my-tea/blob/main/MyTeaUserFlow.pdf) to see what I have planned for the project.

More info and screenshots coming soon!
